- Learn the controls. You can use the mouse to aim and shoot, the WASD keys to move, the spacebar to jump, the C key to crouch, the F key to use items, and the R key to reload. You can also use the number keys to switch weapons, the Q and E keys to lean left and right, and the Z key to zoom in with a sniper rifle.
- Choose your difficulty level. You can select from four difficulty levels: Easy, Regular, Hardened, and Veteran. The higher the difficulty level, the more challenging the enemies are, the less health you have, and the fewer checkpoints you get. Choose a level that suits your skill and preference.
- Select your campaign. You can play as an American soldier in the D-Day invasion of Normandy, a British soldier in the North African desert campaign, or a Soviet soldier in the Battle of Stalingrad. Each campaign has different missions, objectives, and environments. You can also play them in any order you want.
- Follow your objectives. You can see your current objective on the top left corner of the screen. You can also press the Tab key to see a map of your location and your allies and enemies. Try to complete your objectives as quickly and efficiently as possible. You can also explore the map for hidden items, such as health packs, ammo, and weapons.
- Use cover and stealth. You can hide behind walls, crates, barrels, vehicles, and other objects to avoid enemy fire. You can also lean left and right to peek around corners and shoot without exposing yourself too much. You can also use stealth to sneak up on enemies and take them out silently with a knife or a pistol.
- Use different weapons. You can carry two primary weapons and one secondary weapon at a time. You can find various weapons on the ground or from dead enemies. You can also swap weapons with your allies or enemies. Try to use different weapons for different situations. For example, use a rifle for long-range shots, a submachine gun for close-quarters combat, a shotgun for clearing rooms, and a grenade for destroying groups of enemies.
- Work with your allies. You are not alone in this game. You have allies who will fight alongside you and help you complete your objectives. You can also give them commands by pressing the F key when you see an icon above their heads. For example, you can tell them to follow you, hold their position, or attack an enemy. You can also revive them if they get wounded by pressing the F key near them.
- Play online. If you want to test your skills against other players, you can join a multiplayer server online. You can choose from various game modes, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Headquarters, and Search and Destroy. You can also customize your loadout, rank up your level, unlock new weapons and perks, and chat with other players.

Call of Duty 2 is a game that offers hours of entertainment and excitement. Whether you play solo or online, you will have a blast shooting your way through World War II.
