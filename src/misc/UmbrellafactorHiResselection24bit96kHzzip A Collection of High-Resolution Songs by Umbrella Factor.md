## How to play FLAC files on your device
 
FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, which is a type of audio compression that preserves the original data without any loss of quality. This means that FLAC files have the same sound quality as the original source, but with a smaller file size. However, not all devices and software can play FLAC files natively, so you might need to convert them to a different format or use a compatible player.
 
Here are some ways to play FLAC files on your device:
