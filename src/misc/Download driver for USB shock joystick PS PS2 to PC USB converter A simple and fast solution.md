If you have a USB shock joystick for PlayStation or PlayStation 2 and you want to use it on your PC, you may need a driver to enable the force feedback feature. In this article, we will show you how to download and install a driver for your USB shock joystick and also how to use it with some popular games.
 
## Step 1: Identify your USB shock joystick
 
The first step is to identify your USB shock joystick model and vendor. You can do this by plugging it into your PC and checking the device manager. Look for a device with a name like "Twin USB Gamepad" or "USB Vibration Joystick" and note down the hardware ID. The hardware ID is a string of numbers and letters that starts with "VID\_" and "PID\_". For example, "VID\_0810&PID\_0001".

## Step 2: Download the driver
 
Depending on your hardware ID, you may need a different driver for your USB shock joystick. Here are some sources where you can find drivers for some common models:
 
- If your hardware ID is "VID\_0810&PID\_0001", you can download a driver from GitHub[^1^]. This driver is compatible with Windows 10 64-bit and supports rumble feedback. To download it, click on the green "Code" button and then select "Download ZIP". Extract the ZIP file and run the setup file inside the folder named "VID\_0810&PID\_0001 Twin USB Gamepad 64Bit Setup".
- If your hardware ID is different from "VID\_0810&PID\_0001", you can try searching for it on Google or YouTube. You may find some drivers from other sources that work for your model. However, be careful when downloading drivers from unknown or untrusted websites, as they may contain malware or viruses. Always scan the files with an antivirus program before running them.

## Step 3: Test the driver
 
After installing the driver, you should test if it works properly. To do this, open the game controllers window by typing "joy.cpl" in the search box or the run dialog. You should see your USB shock joystick listed as a device. Click on it and then click on "Properties". You should be able to test the buttons, axes, and vibration of your joystick. If everything works fine, you can close the window and enjoy using your joystick.
 
## Step 4: Use the joystick with games
 
Some games may recognize your USB shock joystick automatically and let you use it without any configuration. However, some games may require you to map the buttons and axes of your joystick manually or use an emulator program. Here are some tips on how to use your joystick with some popular games:

- If you want to play games that look for an Xbox 360 controller, you can use [x360ce](http://www.x360ce.com/) to emulate one. This program works together with the driver to give force feedback vibration[^1^]. To use it, download it from its website and extract it to the same folder where the game executable is located. Run x360ce.exe and follow the instructions to configure your joystick.
- If you want to play games that look for a keyboard or mouse input, you can use [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/) to map your joystick buttons and axes to keyboard keys or mouse movements. This program lets you create different profiles for different games and switch between them easily. To use it, download it from its website and run it. Click on "Create" to create a new profile and then assign keys or mouse actions to each button or axis of your joystick.
- If you want to build your own PS2 to PC adapter using an Arduino micro, a PS2 female connector, and some wire, you can follow this GitHub project[^2^]. This project provides the hardware diagram, the software sketch, and the STL file for a 3D printed case. However, note that this project does not support rumble feedback.
