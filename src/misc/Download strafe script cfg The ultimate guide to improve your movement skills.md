## What is Strafe Script Cfg?
  
Strafe script cfg is a configuration file that contains commands and binds that help you perform advanced movement techniques such as long jumps, neo strafes, and bunny hops. These techniques allow you to move faster, jump further, and dodge bullets more effectively. They are especially useful in game modes such as KZ, HnS, Surf, or Battle Royale.
  
There are different types of strafe script cfg for different games and purposes. For example, long jump script cfg helps you jump and duck at the same time while making sure you are not moving forwards or backwards. This allows you to jump further and reach places that are otherwise inaccessible. Neo strafe script cfg helps you strafe with correct timings by automatically releasing the opposite key when you press a strafe key. This prevents you from overlapping your strafes and losing speed. Bunny hop script cfg helps you jump continuously by binding the jump command to your mouse wheel or space bar.

## How Does Strafe Script Cfg Work?
  
Strafe script cfg works by executing commands and binds that are stored in a configuration file. A configuration file is a text file that contains instructions for the game engine. You can create your own configuration file or download one from the internet. To use a configuration file, you need to place it in the appropriate folder of your game directory and execute it in the game console.
  
For example, if you want to use a long jump script cfg for CS:GO, you need to place the file in the folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg and name it autoexec.cfg. Then, you need to open the game console by pressing the tilde key (~) and type +exec autoexec.cfg. This will execute the commands and binds in the file.
  
To enable or disable the long jump script cfg, you can either type ljon or ljoff in the console, or bind it to a key of your choice. For example, if you want to bind it to the L key, you need to add this line to your autoexec.cfg file: bind "l" "lj". Then, you can press L to toggle the long jump script on or off.
