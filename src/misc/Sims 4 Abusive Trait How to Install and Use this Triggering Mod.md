# How to Add an Abusive Trait to Your Sims 4 Characters
 
If you are looking for a way to spice up your Sims 4 gameplay with some drama and conflict, you might be interested in adding an abusive trait to your characters. An abusive trait can make your Sims act in cruel and violent ways towards their partners, friends, or family members, creating realistic and challenging scenarios for your stories.
 
However, the base game of Sims 4 does not have an abusive trait by default, so you will need to use a mod to create one. A mod is a modification that changes or adds something to the game that was not originally there. Mods can enhance your gaming experience by adding new features, content, or options that suit your preferences and style.

One of the most popular mods for creating custom traits is the **More CAS Traits** mod by Vicky Sims[^2^]. This mod allows you to have more than three personality traits for your Sims without changing the user interface or requiring a script. You can also use this mod to set preferences, rewards, and aspiration bonus traits from the base game and packs as well as custom traits made by other creators.
 
To use this mod, you will need to download it from the **Patreon** page of Vicky Sims[^2^] and follow the installation instructions. You will also need to download the **Abusive Trait** mod by **Patreon** user **D.V.S** [^1^], which is a custom trait that includes 20 buffs and 15 whims related to domestic violence and abuse. This mod is a trigger warning for abuse, so please use it with caution and respect.
 
Once you have installed both mods, you can create a new Sim or edit an existing one and choose the abusive trait from the personality section. You will see that your Sim will have different moodlets, actions, and reactions depending on their relationship status, environment, and events. For example, they might get angry when their partner talks to someone else, lash out at their friends for no reason, or feel guilty after hurting someone.
 
The abusive trait can add a lot of drama and challenge to your Sims 4 gameplay, but it can also be very upsetting and disturbing for some players. If you decide to use this mod, please be mindful of your own mental health and well-being, as well as the feelings of others who might see your gameplay. Remember that abuse is never okay in real life, and if you or someone you know is experiencing it, please seek help from a professional or a trusted person.

If you want to explore the consequences and outcomes of having an abusive trait in your Sims 4 gameplay, you might want to create some scenarios that test the limits of your characters and their relationships. For example, you could have an abusive Sim who cheats on their partner with multiple people, a Sim who tries to escape from an abusive relationship, or a Sim who confronts their abuser and stands up for themselves.
 
However, you should also be aware that these scenarios can be very triggering and stressful for some players, especially if they have personal experience with abuse or trauma. Therefore, you should always have a way to exit the game or pause the action if you feel overwhelmed or uncomfortable. You should also avoid sharing your gameplay with others who might not consent to see such content or who might be harmed by it.

Another thing to consider is how the abusive trait affects the other Sims in your game, especially the children and teens. Children and teens who witness or experience abuse can develop emotional and behavioral problems, such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, aggression, or substance abuse. They might also repeat the cycle of abuse in their own relationships later in life. Therefore, you should be careful about how you portray and handle these situations in your game.
 
The abusive trait can be a powerful and realistic tool for creating stories and characters in Sims 4, but it can also be a source of pain and distress for some players. If you choose to use this mod, please do so responsibly and respectfully, and always prioritize your own health and safety over the game. Remember that you are not alone, and that there is always hope and help for survivors of abuse.
